# Misson Statment:

We have div elements to organize and label sections of HTML. But too many div tags makes our HTML document look cluttered and confusing. Even when we identify or classify them with specific names, it's a lot to keep track of. It would be clearer for both developers and browsers if we could use more descriptive HTML elements to arrange our content. That's where semantic elements come in. They allow us to say, "this isn't just a division of text, it's a header." We'll learn more about these semantic elements in this lesson.

# OBJECTIVES

1) Explain the historical reasoning behind semantic elements

Semantics tags have many benefits beyond pure efficiency and site performance in search engines. They help us build better site structures, and more importantly, they can seriously improve websites’ accessibility.

2) Semantic elements’ benefits for designers and developers

HTML5’s semantic elements help structure the code we create, making it more readable and easier to maintain.

They help us think about the structure of our dynamic data, and to choose titles’ hierarchy properly.

They help us differentiate the semantic elements of our markup from the ones we use solely for layout.

And finally, HTML5 semantic elements push us to learn the meanings of HTML elements and better understand our audiences, particularly those who live with disabilities.

# CONCLUSION

If the content within an element is all semantically related, it is best practice to use the appropriate HTML5 semantic element if one applies. This cleans up our code and makes it more readable for developers and more descriptive to browsers. There are a variety of semantic elements you can use to structure your content, and you can also still use div elements to create generic boxes or grouping elements as needed.
